# Quiz website 
Quiz website was designed as an interactive front-end website and uses mainly HTML, CSS and JavaScript technologies. This project demonstrates my skills obtained while studying the Interactive Frontend Development modules of the Code Institute’s Full Stack Developer course.

# UX

## Who is this website for?
For anyone who likes to play quizzes or games.

## What it is that they want to achieve?
Get various questions to answer, know if their answer is correct/incorrect and how well they did on the quiz in the end. 

## How does the project fulfil the users’ needs?
Random multi-choice questions are displayed to a quiz player. S/he is able to click on one of the answers and immediately get the feedback whether it was correct or not. At the end of the quiz the player receives total score and corresponding message depending on the score. Implemented user requirements are added below in the User Stories section.
