# Quiz website 
Quiz website was designed as an interactive front-end website and uses mainly HTML, CSS and JavaScript technologies. This project demonstrates my skills obtained while studying the Interactive Frontend Development modules of the Code Institute’s Full Stack Developer course.

# UX

## Who is this website for?
For anyone who likes to play quizzes or games.

## What it is that they want to achieve?
Users would like to receive various questions to answer, know if their answer is correct/incorrect and how well they did on the quiz in the end. 

## How does the project fulfil the users’ needs?
Random multi-choice questions are displayed to a quiz player. S/he is able to click on one of the answers and immediately get the feedback whether it was correct or not. At the end of the quiz the player sees their total score and corresponding message depending on the score. Implemented user requirements are added below in the User Stories section.

## Wireframes
The [wireframes](https://github.com/AnaStasia1331/ms2-quiz/tree/master/assets/images/wireframes) were created using Balsamiq tool.

## User Stories 
As a quiz player, I want to:

1. navigate throughout the website with intuitive web design;
2. be able to start the quiz from the Home page; 
3. see different quiz questions displayed with multiple options to choose from;
4. see my total score of correct answers while I'm playing the quiz;
5. see the question counter to know how many questions are left to answer;
6. click on an answer and receive the immediate feedback if it's correct or not;
7. get the final page where it's stated how well I did;
8. be able to receive emails about new quizzes loaded on the website;
9. get message about the invalid email address I entered when trying to subscribe to quizzes updates. 
10. be redirected to the Home page after I finish the quiz as I may want to play one more time.

As a quiz owner, I want to:
1. be notified when a quiz player wishes to subscribe to quiz website updates.

## Nice-to-have features (not Implemented)
- Add the Help icon located on the Home page. It should expand on click and provide the instructions for the quiz.
- Improve validation by not accepting the loading of finish-quiz.html without the 'score' url parameter.
